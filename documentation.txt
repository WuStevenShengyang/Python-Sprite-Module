Python Sprite module (Develop with pygame)

#####Creat sprite object: 
sprite_name=sprite.Sprite(file_location,x_position,y_position,colomn,roll) #The last TWO parameters are optional, they are only used for sprite sheet (You don't have to enter them all the time, they are set to 0 by default).

#####Change x & y (Variables):
sprite_name.x=#, sprite_name.y=#.
\\'x' and 'y' represents the TOP-LEFT corner of a sprite.

#####Change size (Variables):
sprite_name.scale=new_scale
\\'new_scale' is how many percentage the size of sprite will be. Enter 0.1 will make the sprite only 10% big. ('new_scale' must be greater than 0)

#####Change image (Class method):
sprite_name.image(new_file_location)
\\After this function was called, the sprite_name now has the image of 'new_file_location'

#####Rendering (Class method):
sprite_name.draw()
\\Draw the sprite on the screen with (x,y) as the position and the size of (x_width*y_width)

#####Flip image(Class method):
sprite.flip(x_flip,y_flip)
\\Both x_flip and y_flip are Boolean values. If 'x_flip==True', flips horizontally; If 'y_flip==True', flips vertically. 


##########SPRITE SHEET PART (Skip if you have no idea about what is a sprite sheet)#########
Last two parameters when creating a sprite object represents:

colomn: Numbers of single pictures horizontally
roll: Numbers of single pictures vertically.

\\After entering 'colomn' and 'roll', the sprite sheet are divided into several frames. You can use 'update()' function to iterate through each frame.

#####Draw each frame
sprite_name.draw_sheet()

#####Update to next frame
sprite_name.update()

#####Animation rate(variable)
sprite.rate=new_rate
\\'new_rate' is how many frames per second. If entering 0, the animation stops.
